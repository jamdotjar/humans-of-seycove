When I was interviewing Maggie, she expressed that her family has always had a bit of an
adventurous side. My first impression of Maggie was that she was a little shy but after
talking more she was happy to tell me her story about moving across the world.
In Grade 8, we packed up and moved to Australia for six months. She expressed that “my
parents wanted a change of scenery.” And since a lot of our extended family lives there, it
felt like the right move. My sister struggled a bit more with the transition, but I saw it as a
once in a lifetime opportunity.
I switched from Seycove, a small public school, to a large private school in Australia. The
transition was a shock, “everything felt stricter, more academic, and a lot more intense.”
But it ended up pushing me in the best way. I made great friends, learned a lot, and really
grew from the experience. It’s easily one of my favorite memories.
The move meant putting a few things on hold, especially sports. I’m a dancer and
swimmer. So, juggling both is a part of my everyday life. “I swim seven like days a week”, so
stepping away from that routine was tough. But the tradeoff was worth it.
She mentioned that coming back to Canada was harder than expected. She had fallen in
love with the lifestyle in Australia. She was so grateful to experience something like that so
early in life.
