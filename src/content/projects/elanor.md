summary: "Driven to make a difference"

When I was 5 years old I said I wanted to be the president. This ambition as well as my
many others comes from the inspiration of the powerful women in my life. I've always looked
up to my mom and the way she does it all. Itâ€™s days when she leaves at 6 in the morning for
work and comes back the next day at 3am when I am in awe and question how she does it.
My aunt, as a social justice worker, has accomplished countless achievements such as
freeing a man from jail after 20 years of wrongfully being charged with murder and starting the
human trafficking helpline in California. These women have shown me I'm capable of doing big
things and making change.
When I grow up, I want to be an actor who makes an impact. My mom being an executive
producer of countless productions and having lived in LA for most of my life, has greatly
influenced my desire to become an actor. However, I know that my ambitions extend beyond
acting, I also want to make a difference.
My drive to create change became more apparent during a school project titled "How
to Change the World." I decided to focus on the Canadian national anthem, a piece often
celebrated for its representation of Canadian nationalism. However, I discovered that its author
had a controversial background that raised important questions about inclusivity and
representation. I wrote a letter to the Prime Minister expressing my concerns about the
anthem's origins. Although the response I received was limited, I was fortunate enough to have
a phone conversation that further ignited my passion for advocacy. That brief interaction was a
powerful moment for me, it opened my eyes to the possibility of making an impact and left me
eager to pursue change on a larger scale.
