Performing music has been one way I’ve lived a full life. I play guitar, I really like to sing and
make music. I wouldn’t say I’m good at it, but it’s deﬁnitely a hobby of mine. It really makes
you appreciate all the music artists out there. I was in a band a couple years ago. There’s a
music store near the Raven and they do band factory classes. They put you into a band and
then they would teach you how to make music and stuA. I did that up until last year, and
looking back there are deﬁnitely a couple of songs I’m really proud of. But the best part of it
was just being with my friends and being able to write music with people who also really
enjoyed it. It was such a cool experience. We would have these concerts at Capilano
University. I was the lead singer, so I was in front of the crowd. It wasn’t like, a huge crowd,
but for me it was pretty big. It was my ﬁrst time singing and I remember being in the
backstage area right about when we were going to go on. And I was so nervous; it was the
most scary feeling. It was also the best. It was this feeling of ‘Holy sh**, I’m about to do this,
this is going to be so cool!’ And when I was on stage it was such an amazing experience.
