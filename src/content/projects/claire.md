summary: Claire, a champion in the making"

I love Field Hockey and Soccer and was Provincial Champions with the Seycove Seyhawks in
2023. I play midfield and striker in both soccer and field hockey. I also really enjoy Art, especially
Socials, and I’m really excited about pursuing my dreams of studying Social Studies at UBC
after graduating this year. I’m most proud of winning Provincials, that’s probably the memory
that made me smile the most. The other one was going to the Eras Tour in Vancouver last
December with my mother. I’ll definitely miss the muffins from the cafeteria too. Coming out of
Covid I got more comfortable asking for help and talking to teachers, which helped me grow a
lot. Ms. Reid was my field hockey coach, so I was really close to her. But my parents had the
biggest impact on me, without them. I wouldn’t be able to achieve my goals on and off the field. I
wish there was more support for the athletic department because last year we didn’t have
enough uniforms and had to share them with the volleyball team. Outside of school, I also really
like skiing in my free time. My favourite actor is Michael Sarah, and one of my favourite movies
is Dead Poets Society. I’m also a big Taylor Swift fan!
