summary: "The most Trustworthy and caring person at seycove"

I am in grade 12 at Seycove, my name is Hannah, and this is my story and my reason to become
a fire fighter. When my parents got divorced, I had to step up for my siblings so they would
always have a strong and reliable person to turn to. My parents are the kind of people who let
me learn from my mistakes and this helped me grow into a trustworthy person with good
leadership skills. I am always there for my siblings whenever they need issues big to small, this
gave me a love for helping people in need. This paired with my uncertainty about what I
wanted to do after high school made me think about what I want to do with my life. My
aspiration after high school is to take a gap year to help people in need around the world. The
first two places, I want to go is Australia and Africa. I want to do this because I want to know
more about the world and what itâ€™s like outside structured school life. Instead of spending 4-5
years grinding for a degree, I might never use. My plan for later in life is to become a firefighter
to help people, not only physically but also emotionally like how I was there for my siblings.
