“I moved from Thailand to Canada when I was four, and it wasn’t always easy.” I had to
learn a whole new culture, try to fit in, and figure out how to communicate with people who
didn’t always understand where I was coming from. But, over time, I found my own voice. It
wasn’t quick or simple, but I learned how to adapt.
One thing that really helped me through all of this was sewing. It started as something
small, just a way to pass the time, but it grew into something more. I started making my
own clothes, experimenting with fabrics and designs, and honestly, it became a form of
expression for me.
Now, I’m aiming to get into UBC Sauder school of business, but it’s not just about the
degree. It’s about creating something meaningful, making a mark, and maybe even
combining my love for design with my future career.
But the thing I really love about sewing is how it connects me to others. I’ve made pieces
for friends, family, and even people I’ve just met, and it’s always the best feeling when they
appreciate something I’ve created with my hands. I think that’s what I want to carry
forward not just to succeed for myself, but to help others feel something through what I do.
Whether it’s making clothes or just connecting with someone, I want to make people feel
seen and heard. And in the end, that’s what it’s all about for me.
