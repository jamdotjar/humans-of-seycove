“I dislocated my knee right there (pointing to the stairs by the cafeteria) three weeks ago
and I'm already back on the trails.” I've only been mountain biking for a short amount of
time, but it has already made a big impact on my life. I picked up biking quickly. When I
started, I was terrible, but as I biked more, I started to become better. Now I am able to
complete most of the trails on Mt Seymour. Unfortunately, three weeks ago, I dislocated
my knee coming down the stairs by the cafeteria. I tried to jump them and landed weirdly
resulting in me crashing and injuring my knee. It's only been three weeks since the accident
but I'm already back on my bike. My mom has been my biggest supporter through all of
this. She’s been the one to believe in me and support me. Without my mom, I wouldn't be
able to go biking every day and I am so very grateful for that. I also have been skiing and
snowboarding for a while now and I can confidently say that biking is by far my favourite
sport. I believe that biking has something to offer to everyone, ranging from downhill all the
way to slalom and XC. Oliver (Grade 8 student)
