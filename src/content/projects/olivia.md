Art was always around me growing up. My dad was really into it (he still is) and most of
my family is too. It wasn’t something I had to go looking for. It was always around me. I
think that is what made it feel so natural.
I remember sitting with my dad, sketching something random, and we didn’t even have
to talk. It was just a quiet bond that felt like we were communicating through art. I’ve
always had a special place in my heart for painting landscapes. There’s something
relaxing I find about painting a road that curves into the distance or a sky that fades into
the trees. I feel like I’m not just painting what I see, I’m trying to give the place a mood.
I gave photography a try. I thought it was interesting, but I also have a terrible record of
losing expensive items. Oops! I decided maybe it wasn’t meant for me. With painting it’s
slower. It allowed me to have time to sit with it, to mess up, to fix it. It did not rush me.
My goal is to study fine arts at the University of Alberta. Not just because I want to get
better, but because I want to be surrounded by people who are also passionate about
art. People who understand how powerful it can be to create something with your
hands and heart.
