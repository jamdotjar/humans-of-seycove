Most people dream of a normal life, job, house, and that’s it but I’ve never really wanted
that. I want to travel the world, climb cliffs in amazing places like Italy, and maybe even
discover something ancient, like lost pyramids or hidden Aztec ruins. My name’s Callum,
I’m in Grade 11 and part of the PLP program, and if I had to describe myself, I’d say I’m
quirky, intelligent, and a little snappy in the way I talk and think. I don’t really see things the
way most people do. A lot of people just take the obvious answer and move on, but I like to
step back, look at all sides, and really think before forming an opinion. I’ve got strong
thoughts on things, like AI, for example, I’m not a fan. I think it makes people lazy and gets
a bit too far into our personal space. I’d rather do things myself and keep the human side of
life alive. One of the biggest parts of my life is rock climbing. I started back in Grade 6, and
it’s been something I’ve stuck with ever since. I love how it challenges me physically and
mentally. I want to climb all over the world, and I’m planning to start competing sometime
soon. Italy’s probably the first place I’d go, something about climbing with all that history
around just sounds incredible. Not everything’s been easy, though. A few years ago, my
grandma passed away, and that really affected me. It was hard to deal with, but over time I
worked through it, and it helped shape the way I see the world now. Someone who’s had a
big impact on my life is Mr. Gibson, one of my teachers. He’s the kind of person you can
actually have deep conversations with. We’ve had real debates that were educational but
also friendly, yes they got pretty heated but that's what made me smarter. In school, I do
well when I’m actually interested in what we’re learning, if I care, I focus. But honestly,
procrastination is my biggest challenge, and I’m still figuring out how to manage it. If I
could take anyone on a big adventure, I’d pick Percy Fawcett, the explorer. He lived for the
unknown, and I get that. I don’t want an ordinary life, I want a life that’s full of discovery,
challenge, and adventure.
