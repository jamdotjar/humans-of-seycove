Everyone knew my situation. I took the bus to school. It was a fairly small bus, and
all of us would talk. So the bus driver knew everything. She was an old lady, in her
sixties. White hair. She heard me saying that I didn’t have money to go on my
senior trip. So she parked the bus, went into to the dean’s office, and said: ‘Here’s
$80, let the girl go on the trip.’ I had a science teacher, Ms. Bernard. She knew that
we were homeless, so every once in awhile she’d pay me $20 to clean her
classroom. Just so that I could do something for my birthday, or get myself pizza
one night, stuff like that. Then our dean Ms. V would let me bring home extra food
from the cafeteria, which wasn’t allowed. If it wasn’t for the educators in my life, I’d
have gone off the rails, the way a lot of kids who have trouble at home do. I was
just craving attention so much. My mom, I love her. But she's never been the best
mental health wise, especially after everything she's gone through. I was also
getting bullied, just relentlessly by kids in my class. I learned pretty quick that
people paid attention to me academically, no other way. In high school my science
teachers were really where it was at. Dr. Khan, especially. He was my marine
biology teacher. It was my favorite class, because I’ve always loved marine biology.
But we also talked about music a lot. That year everything was really up in the air
for me: I’d just transferred schools, I was taking care of my little brother, our
stepdad was domestically violent. That Christmas Dr. Khan gave me a present. Two
presents, actually. The first present was cookies. He said: ‘I always talk to my wife
about you, so she made you cookies.’ His wife baked things for a living, on the
side. So these were like, real cookies. With sea salt on top. Then the second
present was a CD with all the songs we’d ever talked about, mixed-together with
videos of all my favorite animals. I do not like dolphins. I love whales. And I
genuinely have a thing for sharks. So there’d be like a Blink 182 song, paired with a
video of a hammerhead shark. On the card he wrote: ‘Remember, you can always
talk to me.
