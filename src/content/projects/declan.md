summary: "Without music, I’d be a totally different person. It shaped me."

Yeah, of course my dream is to keep pursuing and creating music. I want nothing more. I would
love for my future to give me that option and I think that's always going to be a goal for me. I’ve
always considered myself a creator when it comes to music and a lot of other aspects of my life.
I am especially proud of the things I have created in my high school career, especially the
friendships and relationships I have made throughout my high school experience. I think that
being in choir has really helped me branch out to all different groups because we know what
kind of reputation “choir” kids have. I feel almost a sense of pride being able to have a
conversation with all the different kinds of people among all different groups in school. It’s
probably the thing I look forward to most every day. I am very proud of the people I have
become friends with these last few years.
My dad has always shown me the kind of man I want to be, and I try my best to make him
proud. He always encouraged me to do what makes me happy, which is the reason music has
always had a huge impact on my life.
