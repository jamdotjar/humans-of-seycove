I don't want to work in an office. I want to be on my feet to go do things working with people,
not sitting for six hours in an office. I'm proud of the community I built around myself through
sports and school, I feel I would lose that working in an office. I'm unsure of what I want to do
but I keep doors open and I'm willing to work hard for what I want. I'm going to UBC with a few
friends. I am picking my first-year major in arts but do not want to end with that. I want to
explore and find what I really want to do. I am very excited to graduate and see the real world
outside of what I know but before that I must stay on top of school and work and be able to
balance that with my friends and social life while staying productive. What always keeps me
going and helps me push is the memory of my first moving up the Indian Arm into a beautiful
house I moved there around 6 years ago and have made many memories
living there during the
summers. If I were to choose to tell someone who in school it would be to keep going and don't
give up.
