I was just a kid, and the world was a frightening place. My dad has always talked about his
job as a paramedic, and I don’t think I realized how much it affected me till I took
psychology. I probably shouldn't have known about the violence around me at such a
young age, but I would still listen. Because of this, I struggled with anxiety. It made me
afraid to put myself out there and go outside my comfort zone. Whether it was standing up
in class or talking with a group of new people, I would feel big waves of anxiety. But in the
past couple of years, it’s gotten way better. I’ve met new people and tried new things that
make me nervous. It made me scared. But I don’t feel that way anymore. It changed me for
the better and I feel more comfortable and confident. But what's helped me the most is
helping other people. That’s why I want to become a police officer because I want to help
others, so they don't feel like my dad did.
