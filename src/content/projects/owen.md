This is my journey through music. My name’s Owen, and music has always been at the centre of
my life. I play in a band at school and another one outside of it. Both bands keep me pretty
busy, but I wouldn’t have it any other way. Playing shows, practicing songs, and being part of a
band that shares the same passion is something very valuble to me. We even get paid for some
gigs, which makes it feel even more rewarding Music isn’t just a hobby for me it’s a foundation
for my future. I’ve been building a serious vinyl collection for a few years now. I collect multiple
genres like rock, classic or jazz. One time during my vinyl collecting i found a vinyl that was
more than seventy years old. I think that love for records and music came from my parents.
They’re huge music fans themselves and always had something playing around the house when
I was growing up. That early exposure definitely helped shape me into who I am.
When I’m not playing music or digging through crates of records I like to relax and play video
games. I’ve still got my old Xbox 360 and I spend a lot of time playing Halo and Gears of War.
They’re old now but I love them. I also row on the school team and for me it’s actually a great
way to build teamwork and stay fit. On weekends or during breaks, I head out to our family
cabin. It’s peaceful out there away from the noise of everyday life. It gives me time to reset,
think, and clear my mind. Life’s been good so far, and with everything I’ve got going on, I feel
like I’m building something strong for my future.
