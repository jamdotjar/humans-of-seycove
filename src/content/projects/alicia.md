For me, it’s never been about the medals or the trophies. It’s about the people, the
memories, and the good times that come with playing the game.
Hi, my name is Alicia. I’m a Grade 12 student at Seycove Secondary, and I’m really into
sports, especially hockey. I absolutely love the game, but honestly, what I enjoy most is
the time spent with my friends. For me, sports are all about having fun and making
memories with the people I care about. Winning trophies and medals is great, but that’s
not the main reason I play. “It’s really about hanging out with friends,” I always say,
because to me, it’s more about the experience than the outcome.
I’m also getting ready to move on from high school and head to the University of British
Columbia (UBC) to study business. I’m not totally sure which area of business I want to
focus on yet, but I’m excited to figure it out along the way. “I don’t really set goals” I
say. “I just go with the flow and see where things take me.” I’ve always had a laid-back
attitude, and it’s helped me enjoy high school without stressing too much about the
future.
One of the big reasons I chose to go into business is because of my dad. He owned his
own business, and watching him run it has been a huge influence on me—even though
I didn’t always know exactly what I wanted to do.
While I’m still figuring out the specifics of my future in business, I’m confident that UBC
will help guide me. I’ve always been the type to go with the flow rather than plan
everything out, and that approach has served me well so far. I’m ready to bring that
same mindset to university life.
Whether I end up in marketing, finance, or something else entirely, I’m excited to see
where the journey takes me. But for now, I’m focused on enjoying my last year of high
school, playing sports, and looking forward to whatever comes next.
