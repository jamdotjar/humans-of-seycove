summary: "So many people know how much soccer means to me"
---

I started playing 12 years ago, when I was just three years old, and since that moment I have
loved it. I have also played other sports like baseball, basketball and I skied but none of them
compare to how much I enjoy soccer. I currently train around seven hours a week.
I play for both the BC Soccer Provincial Development Program and Burnaby FC.
Around five years ago, my team and I were supposed to travel to Germany for a tournament,
but it got cancelled because of covid. It was really disappointing because I have never been to
Europe and was so excited to go, but I still hope to visit someday with my friends. Anyway, I
have traveled to different parts of Canada and to Florida for soccer tournaments.
One of my happiest moments was when my soccer team and I went to Montreal, and one of
our coaches was the coach of the Canadian womenâ€™s national team. It was such an exciting and
unforgettable experience.
My team and my coaches have had a huge impact on my life because they have always
supported me, and I spend a lot of time with them. I'm very proud of soccer and everything I
have achieved through it.
Soccer might even help me get into university one day. I want to become a lawyer and that is
one of my biggest goals. I hope I can achieve it.
