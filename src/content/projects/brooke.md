summary: "Standing up, speaking out, staying true"

I have always wanted to go into law because I care about people who don’t always get heard. I
think it’s really important to stand up for others especially when they can’t do it themselves. I
want to help people get their basic human rights and stick up for people who can’t talk for
themselves and giving them a voice. That’s why I’m taking classes like social justice I’m really
enjoying them. I’m hoping to study law at UVIC. Schools been a huge part of my life. I’m in 6
clubs, I do announcements, I work in the cafeteria and try to be involved in everything I can.
One of my biggest struggles in trying to slow down. Sometimes I focus so much on school that I
forget to do things just for fun. I’m working on finding that balance. Soccer helps and so does
music. I’m not big on conflict, but ill face it especially if it means standing up for what’s right.
That’s kind of the reason i want to go into law in the first place.
