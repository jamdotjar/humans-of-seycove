I used to think school was really hard, because I’m dyslexic and I have anxiety. Like, there
were days when I just wanted to give up because everything felt so stressful. But now, I’m
actually doing really well, and I’m proud of that. I guess part of it is because I’m learning
how to use those adaptations to do better.
This year, we had a school project where we did a horror movie, and they gave us options
about what we wanted to do. So, I choose to be the producer of it. Because I know that my
brain is really good at looking at a big picture and breaking it down into little chunks and
organizing it for different people. I never thought I’d be proud of school like this.
Also, the number nine is my least favorite number because my brain automatically
switches which direction the letter is. So, nine could be a “P”, but also it could be a “8”,”1”
or a “7”, and once my brain has decided that “9”is a “7”, every time I read it over it’s going
to be a “7”. Sometimes it feels like there’s just too much to handle. But even with that, I’m
figuring it out. I’m learning to manage my stress and still do well in school and sports.
Honestly, I’m proud of myself because I didn’t think I could do it. But now I see I’m stronger
than I thought.
