summary: "My life is a bleepshow!"

During COVID, I had just left a 12 year relationship. I was grieving, and rebuilding after COVID. I
needed something grounding something to care for. That’s when I adopted two cats, Scout
and Jem, named after the characters in To Kill a Mockingbird. They became my companions
during a time when connection felt impossible.
When Jem died from a heart defect just a year later, I was crushed. But I adopted another
rescue cat, Freja, because I knew Scout still needed a friend and maybe I did too.
After all these changes, I took my first solo trip to Scandinavia. As a woman travelling alone, I
never once felt afraid. The streets were clean, the people kind. I went ziplining, took a fjord
cruise, and let myself breathe again. Norway was a reset. It gave me permission to be brave
and to find joy on my own terms.
I’ve been teaching for 26 years. I’ve saved every thank you card a student has ever written me
two full boxes. When I’m feeling low, I read them. They remind me I’ve had an impact, and that
connection is the core of everything I do.
I’ve struggled with my health for most of my life. I once weighed almost 400 pounds and lost
over 200. But in the past few years after losing both of my parents I gained some of it back. I
eat when I’m stressed. I’m trying to change that now. I want to get back to biking, and rowing. I
have arthritis, so staying still just isn’t an option and makes it more difficult.
I’d like to retire soon. Not because I’m done teaching but because I want to travel while I still
can. But I want to stay here in North Vancouver. My people are here, in North Vancouver.
