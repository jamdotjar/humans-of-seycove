Anthony Bourdain is my biggest inspiration. He was a chef, author, and television
personality. He didn't just cook but searched into the human condition and explored the
stories and experiences of people around the world. He taught culture through food and
told human stories to connect the world. He was an author, and I relate to that because I
love writing. I actually want to be a journalist. I'm going to UBC to study political sciences,
and I got voted to be valedictorian this year by my class. I love sharing my opinions and
talking about basically anything. Except to people younger than me. So, I definitely will
never be a teacher.
A memory that always makes me smile is one time on one of the PLP trips we went to
Arizona. During one of the nights, we snuck out at like 4am and went to the Grand Canyon
to watch the sunrise. It was really cool, admiring where I was and taking it all in with my
best friends, just thinking about where I was and how grateful I am to be here. I always
smile when I think of that moment.
My advice is to just be yourself. Nobody is weird. I literally have a pink phone case. Some
people are going to say, like, oh that's so weird or like say that its gay or whatever, but I
don't care because I like it. Pink is my favourite colour. Like if you like it then it shouldn't
matter what other people think
